        <h2>Quick, easy and flavoursome Italian dish</h2>
        <p>Fuse Italian pasta with spicy, Spanish paprika sausage in this midweek supper with greens and cream cheese.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>400g Penne pasta</li>
            <li>Head of brocolli, broken into small florets</li>
            <li>200g Chorizo, diced</li>
            <li>2 Garlic cloves</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon of fennel seeds</li>
            <li> 200g Cream cheese</li>
            <li>Parmesan</li>
            <li>Rocket leaves</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the penne following pack instructions, adding the broccoli for the final 3 mins. When cooked, drain, reserving a splash of the cooking water.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, fry the chorizo in a large dry frying pan until it starts to turn golden and release its oils. Add the garlic and fennel seeds, and cook for 1 min more. When the penne is cooked, tip it into the pan with the chorizo. Add the cream cheese, stir together until melted, adding a splash of the reserved cooking water so the sauce coats the pasta.</li>
            <li>Serve in bowls, scattered with a few rocket leaves and some grated Parmesan, if you like.</li>
        </ol>
